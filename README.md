## Flutter Row Layout Example
![Layout-Challenge-Specs](https://github.com/Hasnain17/mi_card_flutter/assets/62245237/b8474471-8802-487e-b0e7-88a1519fa6b1)


This Flutter code demonstrates a simple layout using a `Row` widget to arrange multiple containers horizontally. Each container represents a different UI element, showcasing various configurations and properties.

### Code Overview:

- **Containers**: Three containers are used within the `Row` widget.
  1. **Container 1**: A red container with a width of 100.0 and an infinite height. It's positioned at the leftmost side of the row with a bottom margin of 40.0.
  2. **Container 2**: A blue container with a width of 100.0 and an infinite height. It's positioned at the rightmost side of the row with a bottom margin of 40.0.
  3. **Container 3**: A container with a width of 100.0 and a fixed height of 200.0. It contains a `Column` widget with two child containers stacked vertically.
      - **Container 4**: A yellow container with a width and height of 100.0, placed at the top of the column.
      - **Container 5**: A green container with a width and height of 100.0, placed below Container 4.

### Layout Details:

- **MainAxisAlignment**: The `mainAxisAlignment` property of the `Row` widget is set to `MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween`. This distributes the containers evenly along the main axis, ensuring equal space between each container.

- **Child Arrangement**: Containers 1 and 3 are aligned vertically at the top and bottom of the row, respectively. Container 2 is positioned in the middle of the row, with its child containers arranged vertically using a `Column` widget.

### Usage:

This code snippet can be utilized as a starting point for creating more complex layouts in Flutter applications. It demonstrates the versatility of Flutter's layout system and the ease of building responsive UIs.
